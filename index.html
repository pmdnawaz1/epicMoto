                The Hampta Pass trek,labeledd as an easy-to-medium-difficulty
                Himalayan trek, provides breathtaking views of the Kullu Valley
                and Lahaul Valley. Another major draw of the trek is Chandratal
                Lake, which is located en route. The pass is located at an
                elevation of over 4000 metres in the Pir Panjal Range, and the
                route includes incredibly fascinating river crossings.
