              safety in between. To make things more challenging the road is
              filled with dust, rock and mud. Travelling slowly and safely we

              most dangerous passes as the weather here is unpredictable and it
              snows a lot here. So we cross it and then ride on the plains of
              Sarchu till we reach our camps for the night.

              on more plains. You will see how the roof of the world looks like.
              More plains goes on for miles. It&#39;s just flat for miles at
              such great altitude. We now have to conqure the worlds second
              highest motorable pass, Taglangla. We now start desceding passing
              by narrow gorge with roads filled with turns all the way. Before
